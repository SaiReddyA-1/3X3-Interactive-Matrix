# Interactive 3x3 Matrix

## Description

This React project implements an interactive 3x3 matrix where each box changes color upon clicking. Initially, the box clicked turns green. When the last box is clicked, all boxes turn orange in the order they were originally clicked.

## Features

- **3x3 Matrix**: A grid layout consisting of 9 clickable boxes.
- **Color Change**: Boxes turn green upon clicking and turn orange in the sequence of their original clicks when the last box is clicked.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Visual feedback is provided based on the interaction order.

## Technologies Used
